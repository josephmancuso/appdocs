## Welcome To DocsForCode.com!

[DocsForCode.com](http://docsforcode.com) is a site where you can easily host your Markdown files from your GitHub repositories. All you need to do is add your repo and your docs will be hosted. 

You can also add our webhook so we can keep your docs up to date as well as version your documentation for you as you `release` on GitHub.

Give our docs here a quick read and you'll certainly be surprised at how easy it really is.
