## Welcome to DocsForCode.com!

In this documentation, we'll show you how to get started hosting your repository documentation on our site. It truly is quite simple.

### Getting Started

All you'll need is a repository hosted on GitHub.com. 

Head on over to [DocsForCode.com](http://docsforcode.com) and sign in using your GitHub user account. Once signed in you'll see a list of your public repositories. On the right hand side you'll see an add button. Click on the add button and your repository will be hosted. The url will be `your-repo-name.docsforcode.com`.

If a repository with the same name already exists on our site then you will be redirected to the details page and have the opportunity to change the name. Don't worry, changing the name on the details page only corresponds to the subdomain that your docs are hosted at.

## What you'll need to do

We only host documentation written in Markdown. We also only list files in the root directory you provide to us on the details page. In other words we will only pull in files directly in the directory and will ignore folders and subdirectories.

You're documentation can be hosted in any directory and subdirectory on your site as long as you provide us with it after you add your repo.

All of this can be done after you add your repo to our site since we will host default documentation if we do not find any.
