## Styling your documentation.

In addition to normal Markdown, we also provide some custom Markdown you can add to your Markdown files.

### Alert boxes

Like a lot of other documentation, you can make notes to your readers to remind them or tell them things they should know. You can do this by using curly braces with the alert name. Currently you can use 

{alert} {alert} will show a info alert box

{info} {info} will show a info alert box

{note} {note} will show a info alert box

{danger} {danger} will show a danger alert box

That is currently the only custom Markdown supported.
